## Overview
The Guest Management System is a console application designed to manage guest registration for events. The application retrieves unregistered guests from a database, groups them by their designated categories (Standard or VIP), and formats the output according to alphabetical naming conventions. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly report of all unregistered guests for the event.

## Features
- Groups guests by their designated category (Standard or VIP).
- Formats guest names according to specific display formats.
- Outputs a neatly organised report to the console.
- Implements dependency injection for better maintainability and testability.

## Console Output
Here is the console output for the application:
